# Peter's Dealership

## Purpose of the Project

**Description:**
The purpose of my website is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing static website for my car dealership. The website is designed in 3 primary sections. The home page, a shop section to showcase the inventory and outline the specification of our cars in stock, and a meet-up section that provides a oppurtunity for clients to soacalise and show off their new bought rides. Peter's Dealership is a website with an intuitive interface for users to get-to-know, browse and become members of our buisness. This README will guide you through the project's key aspects and its development process.

## User Experience Design Features

**Intuitive Scroll:**

- Each page is designed to end slightly before the end of the browsers viewing height. This is done so that the following page's heading is visible from the previous page. This entices users to keep scrolling down and view the following pages. It also disproves the misconception that the website finishes there. I have implemented this for all my supported devices.

**Typography:**

- Primary Font: [courgette] I chose courgette because of it's simplistic yet stylish looks, its easy to read and draws attention. "Courgette communicates warmth, artfulness, and creativity. It is comforting yet expressive. Courgette is perfect for brands looking to add a creative, comforting, DIY voice." - Typogram

- Secondary Font: [sans-serif] I chose my secondary font as sans-serif as its the basic font built across all browsers and supported everywhere. If by some reason my main font doesn't load I can always rely and depend on sans-serif.

**Color Scheme:**

- Primary Color: [#2f4f4f] I Chose DarkSlateGray because it holds significant importance in graphic design as it enhances visual impact. Its depth creates contrast, making other elements stand out and catch the viewer's attention.
  
- Secondary Color: [#f2f2f2] I chose my secondary colour for it's neutrality and simplicity. Light gray is a neutral colour that can create a clean and simple aesthetic. It doesn't distract from the content and is often used as a background colour to make other elements stand out. this is why it can be paired perfectly with the DarkSlateGray to emphasise content.
